/**
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.

 * and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
 * determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
